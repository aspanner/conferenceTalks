# Hello & Getting Started
The following instructions are a step by step guide to get your first hands on experience with bootC (bootable containers) or RHEL Image mode.
There is a CLI way to achieve this but for first time uses we are utilizing awesome Podman Desktop.

## First Things First
Install Podman Desktop on your Fedora, Linux, Windows or Mac machine.
A good place to start is here: https://podman-desktop.io/docs/installation

## Start Podman Desktop
If you've got everything right then starting your Podman Desktop should greet you with a screen similar to this:

##Building your first operating system iso image
Without further delay, let's get cracking to get the first operating system build underway. After all time is money the Wolf of Wallstreet once said to me - when I was young.

On the left hand side go the 2nd icon from the top (looks like a container and the tooltip reads 'Containers') and click it. On that screen then click on the top right hand side the '+ Create' button. Your screen should look like this:
